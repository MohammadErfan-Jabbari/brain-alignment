# Decision Log

Append-only. One entry per real decision. Newest at the bottom. Format: ID, date, decision,
rationale, and what would reverse it. Reference other docs with relative links.

### D001 — 2026-06-08 — Repo is a single-thesis research workspace, not a Nexus port

**Decision:** Build `brain-alignment` as a self-contained, lightweight research repo. Do **not** port
the Nexus v2 `.nexus/` stage-machine (`config.yaml` gates, dual `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md` surfaces,
reconciliation).
**Rationale:** Nexus v2's documented failure mode was over-coupling; v1's was over-specification. For
one owner / one paper / one node, that machinery is pure overhead. We keep the epistemic spine, drop
the bureaucracy. See `../03-methodology.md`.
**Reverses if:** this grows into a multi-paper program needing cross-project memory.

### D002 — 2026-06-08 — Knowledge base lives in `docs/`, not `.nexus/`

**Decision:** All durable research memory (charter, landscape, decisions, timeline, hypotheses,
experiments, literature, learnings, upspeed) lives in `docs/`, per Erfan's explicit request.
**Rationale:** One obvious place; plain markdown; survives across sessions; no hidden control plane.
**Reverses if:** Erfan prefers a different top-level location.

### D003 — 2026-06-08 — Minimal uv environment, always `uv run`

**Decision:** `pyproject.toml` with `[tool.uv] package = false`, Python 3.11, `.venv/`, no `src/`
scaffolding or sample modules. Add libraries with `uv add` as needed; torch pinned to the cu128
index. All Python runs via `uv run`.
**Rationale:** Erfan's request for a minimal env; mirrors the proven brain-jepa setup on this box.
**Reverses if:** we need to package/distribute code (then flip `package`).

### D004 — 2026-06-08 — Self-contained literature: copy canonical notes in

**Decision:** Copy the 20 brain-alignment/distillation canonical paper notes and the prior dossier +
oracle review from the Nexus v1 archive into `docs/literature/`.
**Rationale:** The repo should not depend on the soon-to-be-overhauled Nexus tree to be useful.
**Reverses if:** never; provenance preserved in `literature/_prior-work/`.

### D005 — 2026-06-08 — Curated subagents, adapted to this repo

**Decision:** Define a small set of research subagents (`lit-scout`, `paper-digest`,
`oracle-reviewer`, `session-logger`) in `.claude/agents/`, adapted to the `docs/` layout. Skip the
~9 Nexus stage-bound agents wholesale; add more only when a need recurs.
**Rationale:** Adaptive semistructure — earn each agent. The adversarial `oracle-reviewer` reproduces
the single most valuable artifact from the prior work (the HOLD review that exposed the gaps).
**Reverses if:** a dropped agent proves repeatedly needed.

### D006 — 2026-06-08 — Scope lock: MSc thesis, feasibility-first, edge deferred

**Decision:** This repo serves Erfan's **MSc thesis (ML for Health, UC3M)** — the NeurIPS track is
dropped. Tentative deadline **~end of August 2026** (exact TBD). The first objective is a
**fundamental feasibility question — does the LLM↔brain alignment signal actually carry usable
information that helps a downstream task, beyond confounds?** The "edge"/deployment framing is
**explicitly deferred** until that question is answered.
**Rationale:** Erfan's direction: establish whether the claim holds before designing for deployment.
Matches the prior oracle review (operationalize + de-risk first) and avoids over-claiming.
**Reverses if:** the feasibility question resolves positively and we move to the deployment story.

### D007 — 2026-06-08 — Continuous atomic commits as the granular project timeline

**Decision:** Commit changes **continuously and atomically** — each meaningful step is its own scoped
commit with a proper conventional-commit message — so git history is a fine-grained, inspectable
record of file changes over time. This is **in addition to, never a replacement for, the docs
record:** decisions still go in this file and every session still gets a `../timeline/` log. Docs
carry the *why* (reasoning, narrative); git carries the *what/when* (mechanical diffs). Rules
unchanged: scoped staging only (never `git add -A`/`.`), no `--amend`, push only when asked.
**Rationale:** Erfan wants a detailed, granular overview of how the repo evolved — and the decision
log + timeline remain the canonical research record.
**Reverses if:** never expected — it is a working norm.
